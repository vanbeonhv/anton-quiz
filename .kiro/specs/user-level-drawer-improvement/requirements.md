# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Level Drawer Improvement feature enhances the Anton Questions App by replacing the current tooltip-based level display with a more reliable drawer component and implementing centralized user level data management. This addresses positioning bugs in the current tooltip system and ensures consistent user level information display throughout the application.

## Glossary

- **Level_Drawer**: A slide-out panel component that displays comprehensive user level information
- **Level_Badge**: The existing clickable badge component that triggers the level information display
- **User_Level_Provider**: A React context provider that centralizes user level data management
- **Drawer_Component**: A shadcn/ui drawer component for consistent slide-out panel behavior
- **User_Stats_Hook**: The existing React Query hook that fetches user statistics including level data

## Requirements
