# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating all direct fetch API calls throughout the application to use React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for better data management, caching, error handling, and user experience. The project currently has React Query partially implemented for read operations but still uses direct fetch calls for mutations (POST, PUT, DELETE) and some individual page data fetching.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API calls to use React Query, so that I have consistent data management, automatic caching, and better error handling throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component needs to fetch data THEN it SHALL use React Query hooks instead of direct fetch calls
2. WHEN any component needs to perform mutations (POST, PUT, DELETE) THEN it SHALL use React Query mutations with proper invalidation
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL have consistent error handling and loading states
4. WHEN data is fetched THEN it SHALL be automatically cached and revalidated according to React Query best practices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless data updates across the application, so that when I create, update, or delete items, the UI reflects changes immediately without manual refreshes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new item THEN the relevant queries SHALL be invalidated and refetched automatically
2. WHEN a user updates an item THEN the cache SHALL be updated optimistically or invalidated appropriately
3. WHEN a user deletes an item THEN the item SHALL be removed from all relevant cached data
4. WHEN mutations complete successfully THEN success feedback SHALL be provided to the user
5. WHEN mutations fail THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized API logic with proper TypeScript types, so that API calls are maintainable, type-safe, and reusable across components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API functions are created THEN they SHALL be properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN mutations are defined THEN they SHALL include proper request and response types
3. WHEN API logic is implemented THEN it SHALL be centralized in appropriate service files
4. WHEN components use API hooks THEN they SHALL have full type safety for request/response data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved loading states and error handling, so that I have clear feedback about the application's state and any issues that occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN appropriate loading indicators SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN user-friendly error messages SHALL be shown
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms where appropriate
4. WHEN mutations are submitted THEN buttons SHALL be disabled to prevent duplicate submissions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimistic updates for better user experience, so that the UI feels responsive even before server confirmation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users perform quick actions (like toggling states) THEN the UI SHALL update immediately with optimistic updates
2. WHEN optimistic updates fail THEN the UI SHALL revert to the previous state and show an error
3. WHEN optimistic updates succeed THEN the cache SHALL be synchronized with the server response
4. WHEN implementing optimistic updates THEN they SHALL only be used for appropriate mutation types
