# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Update CSS with unified grid system and custom properties
  - Replace current grid definitions in `app/globals.css` with unified system
  - Add CSS custom properties for responsive column widths
  - Create standardized `.question-cell` classes with consistent padding
  - Remove conflicting CSS rules that cause alignment issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 2. Refactor QuestionTable component to use unified grid structure
  - Update header structure to use consistent `question-table-grid` class
  - Apply standardized `question-cell` classes to all header elements
  - Remove manual padding and spacing that conflicts with grid system
  - Ensure skeleton loader matches exact grid structure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 3. Update QuestionRow component with consistent cell structure
  - Apply same `question-table-grid` class as header
  - Wrap all content in standardized `question-cell` elements
  - Remove manual responsive logic in favor of CSS-only approach
  - Ensure all cells use consistent padding and alignment
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 4. Implement mobile overlay approach for responsive behavior
  - Create mobile overlay that maintains grid structure
  - Position overlay absolutely over hidden desktop columns
  - Remove grid structure changes that break alignment
  - Test mobile layout without disrupting desktop grid
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Fix responsive breakpoints and column visibility
  - Update CSS media queries to use custom properties
  - Ensure column hiding doesn't affect grid alignment
  - Test all breakpoints for consistent column boundaries
  - Verify smooth transitions between responsive states
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Test and validate column alignment across all scenarios
  - Verify header and data row columns align perfectly
  - Test with different content lengths and screen sizes
  - Check alignment during loading states and empty states
  - Validate cross-browser compatibility
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ]* 7. Add visual regression tests for alignment
  - Create automated tests to verify column boundaries match between header and rows
  - Test responsive breakpoint transitions
  - Add tests for mobile overlay positioning
  - Verify consistent spacing across all components
  - _Requirements: All requirements_

- [ ]* 8. Performance testing and optimization
  - Measure layout performance impact of CSS changes
  - Test with large datasets to ensure no performance regression
  - Optimize CSS for minimal layout recalculations
  - Add monitoring for alignment issues in production
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
