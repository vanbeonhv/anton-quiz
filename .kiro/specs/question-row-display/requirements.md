# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature fixes the column alignment issues in the current question table display. The existing row-based table layout has misaligned columns between the header and data rows, causing visual inconsistency and poor user experience. This update will ensure perfect column alignment, consistent spacing, and proper responsive behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing questions, I want to see perfectly aligned columns between the table header and data rows, so that the interface looks professional and is easy to scan.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the questions table THEN the header columns SHALL align exactly with the data row columns
2. WHEN displaying question rows THEN each column SHALL have consistent width and padding across all rows
3. WHEN viewing different screen sizes THEN the column alignment SHALL remain perfect at all responsive breakpoints
4. WHEN scrolling through questions THEN the column boundaries SHALL remain visually consistent

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user scanning questions, I want consistent spacing and padding within each column, so that the content is properly organized and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying table headers THEN the padding SHALL match exactly with the data row padding
2. WHEN displaying column content THEN the horizontal spacing SHALL be consistent across all columns
3. WHEN displaying text content THEN the vertical alignment SHALL be centered within each cell
4. WHEN displaying badges and tags THEN they SHALL be properly contained within their column boundaries
5. WHEN hovering over rows THEN the hover effect SHALL not disrupt column alignment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the column alignment to remain perfect across all responsive breakpoints, so that the table looks professional on any screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop (â‰¥1024px) THEN all 6 columns SHALL be perfectly aligned with consistent spacing
2. WHEN viewing on tablet (768px-1023px) THEN the 5 visible columns SHALL maintain perfect alignment
3. WHEN viewing on mobile (<768px) THEN the 2-column layout SHALL have proper alignment between header and content
4. WHEN transitioning between breakpoints THEN the column alignment SHALL remain consistent without visual glitches

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interacting with questions, I want the grid system to be robust and maintainable, so that future changes don't break the alignment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new content to columns THEN the grid system SHALL automatically maintain alignment
2. WHEN modifying column content THEN the layout SHALL remain stable without manual adjustments
3. WHEN loading data THEN the skeleton loader SHALL match the exact grid structure of loaded content
4. WHEN displaying different content lengths THEN the grid SHALL handle overflow consistently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this code, I want a clean and consistent CSS grid implementation, so that the alignment issues are permanently resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the grid THEN the CSS SHALL use a single, consistent grid-template-columns definition
2. WHEN applying responsive breakpoints THEN the grid changes SHALL be clearly defined and tested
3. WHEN styling components THEN the padding and margins SHALL be standardized across all elements
4. WHEN debugging layout issues THEN the grid structure SHALL be easily inspectable and modifiable
