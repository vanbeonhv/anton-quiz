# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Level System feature enhances the Anton Questions App by introducing an experience point (XP) and leveling system that rewards users for correctly answering questions. Users earn XP based on question difficulty and progress through developer-themed levels, providing gamification and motivation for continued learning.

- **XP_System**: The experience point tracking and level calculation system
- **Level_Calculator**: Component that determines user level based on total XP
- **Question_Attempt_API**: The existing API endpoint for submitting question answers
- **User_Stats_Model**: The existing database model that tracks user statistics
- **Level_Data**: The JSON configuration file containing level thresholds and titles
