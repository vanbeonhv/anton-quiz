# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables administrators to efficiently import multiple questions into the system by pasting a JSON array. The feature provides a two-step workflow: first parsing the JSON input, then allowing review and editing before final submission. This streamlines the process of adding multiple questions compared to creating them individually.

## Glossary

- **Admin UI**: The administrative interface located at `/admin` where administrators manage questions and tags
- **Bulk Import System**: The feature that allows importing multiple questions simultaneously via JSON input
- **JSON Parser**: The component that validates and transforms JSON input into Question objects
- **Review Modal**: The interface that displays parsed questions and allows editing before submission
- **Question Object**: A data structure containing question text, options, correct answer, difficulty, explanation, and tags

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to access a bulk import button in the admin UI, so that I can initiate the process of importing multiple questions at once

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Admin UI SHALL display a bulk import button in the question management section
2. WHEN the administrator clicks the bulk import button, THE Bulk Import System SHALL open a modal with a text input area
3. THE Bulk Import System SHALL provide clear instructions indicating that JSON array format is expected
4. THE Bulk Import System SHALL include a cancel action to close the modal without processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to paste a JSON array of questions into a text area, so that I can prepare multiple questions for import

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Bulk Import System SHALL provide a text area that accepts multi-line JSON input
2. THE Bulk Import System SHALL display a parse button to process the JSON input
3. WHEN the administrator enters text, THE Bulk Import System SHALL maintain the formatting of the pasted content
4. THE Bulk Import System SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the text area is ready for input

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the system to parse my JSON input and validate it, so that I can identify any formatting errors before proceeding

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator clicks the parse button, THE JSON Parser SHALL attempt to parse the input as a JSON array
2. IF the input is not valid JSON, THEN THE JSON Parser SHALL display an error message indicating the parsing failure
3. IF the input is valid JSON but not an array, THEN THE JSON Parser SHALL display an error message indicating array format is required
4. WHEN parsing succeeds, THE JSON Parser SHALL transform each array element into a Question Object
5. IF any required question fields are missing, THEN THE JSON Parser SHALL display an error message identifying the missing fields

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to review the parsed questions in a modal before submitting, so that I can verify the data was interpreted correctly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing completes successfully, THE Bulk Import System SHALL close the input modal and open the Review Modal
2. THE Review Modal SHALL display all parsed Question Objects in a readable format
3. THE Review Modal SHALL show question text, options, correct answer, difficulty, explanation, and tags for each question
4. THE Review Modal SHALL provide navigation between multiple questions if more than one is present
5. THE Review Modal SHALL display a count indicating the total number of questions to be imported

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to edit individual questions in the review modal, so that I can correct any issues before final submission

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Review Modal SHALL provide editable fields for each question property
2. WHEN the administrator modifies a field, THE Review Modal SHALL update the corresponding Question Object
3. THE Review Modal SHALL validate edited fields to ensure required data is present
4. THE Review Modal SHALL maintain changes across navigation between different questions
5. THE Review Modal SHALL provide visual indication of which fields are required

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to submit the reviewed questions for bulk insertion, so that they are added to the question database

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Review Modal SHALL provide a submit button to initiate bulk insertion
2. WHEN the administrator clicks submit, THE Bulk Import System SHALL call the bulk insert API endpoint with all Question Objects
3. WHILE the bulk insert is processing, THE Bulk Import System SHALL display a loading indicator
4. WHEN the bulk insert succeeds, THE Bulk Import System SHALL display a success message indicating the number of questions added
5. WHEN the bulk insert succeeds, THE Bulk Import System SHALL close the Review Modal and refresh the question list
6. IF the bulk insert fails, THEN THE Bulk Import System SHALL display an error message with details about the failure
7. THE Review Modal SHALL provide a cancel action to abort the import process without submitting
