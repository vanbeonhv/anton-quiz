# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a UX issue in the Individual Question Page where users see an "already attempted" message briefly before the API response completes when submitting an answer. The solution involves creating a reusable loading overlay component that shows a spinner during API calls and prevents the display of intermediate states that create poor user experience.

## Glossary

- **Loading Overlay Component**: A reusable React component that displays a loading spinner over its children during async operations
- **Individual Question Page**: The page component that displays a single question for users to answer
- **Submit Answer Mutation**: The React Query mutation that handles submitting user answers to questions
- **API Response State**: The current status of an API call (pending, success, error)
- **UX Blink**: The undesirable visual effect where content briefly appears and disappears during state transitions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user answering questions, I want to see a clear loading indicator when submitting my answer, so that I understand the system is processing my response and don't see confusing intermediate messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the submit answer button, THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL display a spinner immediately
2. WHILE the submit answer mutation is pending, THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL prevent the display of "already attempted" messages
3. WHEN the API response completes successfully, THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL hide and show the final result
4. IF the API response fails, THEN THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL hide and display appropriate error feedback
5. THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL accept children components as props for flexible usage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable loading overlay component, so that I can consistently apply loading states across different parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL be implemented as a reusable React component
2. THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL accept a loading boolean prop to control visibility
3. THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL accept children props to wrap any content
4. THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL display a centered spinner when loading is true
5. THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL maintain the original layout dimensions when showing the overlay

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the loading state to be visually consistent with the app's design system, so that the experience feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL use the existing Loader2 icon from lucide-react
2. THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL use the primary-green color for the spinner
3. THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL apply a semi-transparent background overlay
4. THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL center the spinner both horizontally and vertically
5. THE Loading Overlay Component SHALL maintain accessibility standards with proper ARIA labels
