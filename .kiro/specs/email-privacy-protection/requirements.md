# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements email privacy protection across all API responses to ensure that user email addresses are only visible to the respective user and not exposed to other users. Currently, the application exposes user emails in scoreboard and other API responses, which creates privacy concerns.

## Glossary

- **API_Response**: HTTP response returned by server-side API endpoints
- **Current_User**: The authenticated user making the API request
- **Other_Users**: All users in the system except the Current_User
- **Email_Field**: The userEmail property in API response objects
- **Scoreboard_API**: API endpoints that return leaderboard data with user information
- **User_Stats_API**: API endpoint that returns individual user statistics
- **Privacy_Filter**: Server-side logic that conditionally includes or excludes email data
- **UI_Components**: Frontend React components that display user information
- **Email_Display**: Visual representation of email addresses in the user interface

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my email address to remain private from other users, so that my personal information is protected while using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Other_Users view Scoreboard_API responses, THE API_Response SHALL exclude Email_Field for all users except Current_User
2. WHEN Current_User views Scoreboard_API responses, THE API_Response SHALL include Email_Field only for Current_User's own entry
3. WHEN Current_User accesses User_Stats_API, THE API_Response SHALL include Email_Field for Current_User
4. IF Current_User is not authenticated, THEN THE API_Response SHALL exclude all Email_Field values
5. WHERE Privacy_Filter is applied, THE API_Response SHALL maintain all other user data fields unchanged

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent privacy filtering mechanism across all API endpoints, so that email privacy is uniformly enforced throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Privacy_Filter SHALL be implemented as a reusable utility function
2. WHEN any API endpoint returns user data, THE Privacy_Filter SHALL be applied before sending API_Response
3. THE Privacy_Filter SHALL accept Current_User identifier and user data array as parameters
4. THE Privacy_Filter SHALL return modified user data with Email_Field conditionally included
5. WHERE multiple API endpoints exist, THE Privacy_Filter SHALL be consistently applied across all endpoints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want email addresses to be hidden in the user interface when viewing other users' information, so that I cannot see other users' private email addresses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI_Components display Other_Users information, THE Email_Display SHALL be hidden or replaced with placeholder text
2. WHEN UI_Components display Current_User information, THE Email_Display SHALL show Current_User's actual email address
3. THE UI_Components SHALL conditionally render Email_Display based on user ownership
4. WHERE Email_Field is null or undefined in API_Response, THE UI_Components SHALL handle gracefully without displaying email
5. THE UI_Components SHALL maintain consistent styling and layout regardless of Email_Display visibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure that email privacy changes do not break existing functionality, so that the application continues to work correctly after implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Privacy_Filter is applied, THE API_Response SHALL maintain the same response structure
2. THE API_Response SHALL preserve all non-email user data fields in their original format
3. WHEN Current_User views their own data, THE API_Response SHALL include Email_Field with correct value
4. THE Privacy_Filter SHALL handle cases where Email_Field is null or undefined gracefully
5. WHERE API_Response contains Current_User data, THE Email_Field SHALL remain visible and accurate
